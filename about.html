			<h1 class="welcome-title">Our Story</h1>
			<p class = "index-p">Embarking on my career journey armed with a strong foundation in theoretical knowledge, I soon encountered a common challenge faced by many aspiring engineers â€“ the elusive practical dimension. This personal quest for a deeper understanding of my field drove me to bridge the gap between theory and real-world application. Through perseverance, hands-on experiences, and a commitment to continuous learning, I discovered the invaluable practical insights that transformed my approach to structural engineering and the Finite Element Method (FEM). Today, I am passionate about sharing these insights with others, creating a platform where theoretical knowledge meets tangible practice, and where engineers of all levels can embark on their own transformative journeys.</p>
